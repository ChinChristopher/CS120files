                    1.1  Files and File Extensions
                    Now knowing the two ways of managing files we can now look at types of file extensions and their purpose. Types of file extensions vary between what the files are categorized as it usually falls in a handful of file types Audio, video, picture, documents, executables and text files. Once users figure out what type of files they have then extensions will be attached per the type of file, some common file extensions are as follows docx, xls, txt, mp3, ppt just to name a few. Suppose a user downloads a new audio file there will automatically a file extension attached to the file name ending in .mp3 knowing that it is a .mp3 file the computer then will determine which application(s) can read and playback files of these specific extensions. In a scenario where perhaps a user wanted to rename the file and accidently change file extension the computer will lose the ability to determine and automatically open the file using the correct application.2.0 Retrieval and Storage of Files
                    Files are usually saved locally on the computer’s memory device such as a SSD/HDD. The way files get created and saved is through file paths. File paths are the route that the file must go through to get to its final save point. An example of this would be normal word document once created must be saved onto the PC, the path will look something like this <C:\Users\users name\Documents\>
                        and then the file will be either in this section or if the user has created a sub folder specifically for word documents it might look something like this <C:\Users\users name\Documents\sub-folder name\file name>
                            . More technically speaking the way the file is created is when you save a file to the SSD/HDD they are stored as clusters common cluster sizes are 2048 bytes 4096 bytes 8192 bytes. The clusters once stored in the hard drive don’t necessarily stay all in one cluster due to the size of the file. And since it does not stay in one cluster the bits of the file can be spread around the storage disk at random places. The reason it is stored in small pieces across the computer’s memory is so that significant files that may be needed to run operating systems and necessary programs are not entirely wiped out in case of damage to the memory component.
                            The way the file is not lost in the storage disk is by using what is called File Allocation Table (FAT). FAT is a form of operating system that is specifically on the storage disk to recording the location of each cluster and the sequence of the desired saved file so at a future point when the user calls the files all clusters will be found in the correct sequence and all the fragments are found properly to reproduce the file as it originally was.
                            In addition, there is significant distinction that deals with file path names is the difference between the forward slash and backslash in the file path name. When dealing with local storage in Windows operating systems, a backslash (\) is used to represent the separation of folders. In every other instance and in other operating systems a forward slash is used. Operating systems such as Linux, OS X, and Android use the forward slash (/) in file directories and pathnames. Web addresses also use the forward slash routinely.
                            2.1 Retrieval and Storage of Files comparison to LMC concepts
                            In the LMC we saw that data in the registry was allocated to slots in memory so it could later be retrieved if needed- just like files, they too get allocated space within memory to be saved for a later date if needed. We also see that when anything that needs to be retrieved from in both instances of LMC model and regular files they both need to know where the file location site is of course files using the file path method while LMC uses the location denoted by numbers.
                            2.2 Logical & Physical View
                            In computer storage, there are two forms of understanding file management, which are logical view and physical view. The logical view involves the contents and attributes of files viewed by the user. This involves the things that the user is able to view and edit. The physical view is how the bytes are actually stored in clusters to take up physical space on the memory device, such as a hard disk or SSD.
                            2.3 File Access Methods
                            There are several ways the computer is able to retrieve whole file data. There are three different procedures for retrieval. The first of the three is the sequential access method. The sequential access method calls for the computer to retrieve each cluster in logical order in file addresses that are located directly next to each other on the memory disk. This means that the file is read in sequence from beginning to end. A majority of all computer files are read with the sequential access method. The second retrieval method is the random access method. The random access method involves using a hash algorithm to find the file location address. This involves the data clusters that are spread out along the memory device. The final file retrieval method is the indexed access method, also called indexed sequential access method (ISAM). ISAM was created by IBM and allows for records to be accessed sequentially or randomly with an index. The index is used in several ways. For example, a database of students can be sorted through by last name or they could be sorted by ID number. In these cases the last name and the ID numbers are the keys to the index, respectively.
                            3.0 File Management Differences between Operating Systems
                            Earlier we touched upon the different ways file paths are displayed in the different operating systems, we also touched on the difference between linux based machines and Windows is the only one to use the backslash (\) to denote moving into a new subfolder while in linux based machines they denote using the forward slash (/). We also see that in linux there is no such drive called C: drive rather they use root directory and then grafted into a tree. We noticed in our findings that Macintosh and Ubuntu based computers push the new style of file management of tagging and labeling by making the tools necessary to tag and label very visible to the user right in the file management system while windows mainly uses the old management way of master folders and subfolders
